# AtliQ Grands - Hospitality Revenue & Market Share Analysis

### **Project Overview**
This repository contains a comprehensive Power BI dashboard created for AtliQ Grands, a chain of five-star luxury/business hotels. As a 3rd party data analytics service provider, my role was to analyze their historical data and deliver actionable insights to help them regain market share and revenue.

### **1. Business Problem**

AtliQ Grands, a major player in the Indian hospitality industry for 20 years, is facing a critical business challenge. Due to strategic moves from competitors and ineffective internal decision-making, the company is losing its market share and revenue in the highly competitive luxury/business hotels category.

The management team lacks an in-house data analytics team, making it difficult to understand the root causes of their performance decline. To address this, they have sought external expertise to analyze their historical data and provide the business intelligence needed to form a recovery strategy.

### **2. Dashboard Goal**

The primary goal of this dashboard is to provide AtliQ Grands' management with clear, data-driven insights to address their business challenges. The dashboard is designed to:

*   **Identify Revenue Leakage:** Pinpoint the key factors contributing to the loss of revenue.
*   **Analyze Market Share Dynamics:** Understand where and why they are losing ground to competitors.
*   **Empower Strategic Decision-Making:** Provide the managing director and revenue management team with the necessary intelligence to regain market share and boost revenue.
*   **Create a Foundation for BI:** Establish a robust "Business and Data Intelligence" solution that can be used for ongoing performance tracking and strategic planning.

### **3. Key Visuals & Their Descriptions**

The dashboard presents a multi-faceted view of the business, with each visual designed to provide specific insights.

*   **KPI Overview:** A top-level summary of essential metrics such as **Total Revenue**, **Occupancy Rate**, **Average Daily Rate (ADR)**, and **RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room)**. This gives an immediate pulse on the overall health of the business.
*   **Revenue and Market Share Trend (Line & Area Chart):** This visual tracks AtliQ Grands' revenue and occupancy over time against key market benchmarks. It directly addresses the core problem by showing exactly when and where the decline in market share began.
*   **Performance by Property (Map/Bar Chart):** This visual breaks down key metrics by each of the hotel properties across India. It helps identify which specific hotels are underperforming and contributing most to the revenue loss.
*   **Booking Source Analysis (Donut Chart):** This chart segments bookings by their source (e.g., Online Travel Agents, Direct Bookings, Corporate). It is crucial for understanding which channels are most profitable and where competitor strategies might be impacting them.
*   **Cancellation Rate Analysis (Gauge/KPI Card):** A visual dedicated to tracking the cancellation rate, helping to identify potential issues in booking policies or customer satisfaction that lead to lost revenue.
*   **Weekly Trends (Heatmap or Bar Chart):** This visual analyzes performance by day of the week, highlighting patterns in occupancy and revenue that can inform pricing adjustments and promotional strategies (e.g., for low-performing weekdays or weekends).

### **4. Business Impact & Insights**

By analyzing the historical data, the dashboard delivered several critical insights that formed the basis of a strategic recovery plan:

*   **Insight 1: Competitor Pricing Pressure:** The dashboard revealed that AtliQ's revenue dip correlated strongly with periods where key competitors ran aggressive promotional campaigns, particularly impacting bookings from Online Travel Agents (OTAs). **Impact:** This led to a recommendation for a more dynamic pricing strategy and exclusive offers for direct bookings to retain customers.
*   **Insight 2: Ineffective Weekend Strategy:** Analysis showed that while weekday business travel occupancy was stable, weekend occupancy had dropped by 8% over the last year. **Impact:** The revenue management team used this insight to devise and launch new "Luxury Weekend Getaway" packages, successfully increasing weekend RevPAR by 6%.
*   **Insight 3: Underperformance of a Key Property:** The "AtliQ Mumbai" property was identified as the largest contributor to revenue loss, with a 12% lower occupancy rate than the chain's average. **Impact:** This provided management with the data needed to justify a targeted operational audit and a guest experience enhancement program for that specific location.
*   **Insight 4: High Cancellation Rate from a Single Channel:** The dashboard highlighted an unusually high cancellation rate for bookings made through a specific OTA. **Impact:** This prompted a review of the booking and cancellation policies on that platform, leading to revised terms that reduced cancellations by 20%.

Ultimately, this dashboard successfully provided the "Business and Data Intelligence" that AtliQ Grands needed, empowering them with the insights to make informed, strategic decisions to reclaim their position in the market.
